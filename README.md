# jsats3d

jsats3d was developed by Kleinschmidt to assist researchers with cleaning and managing small scale acoustic telemetry studies (<1000 tagged individuals, <20 receivers) The resulting dataset represents a standardized, repeatable and defensible product. This notebook carries out every task one may have when analyzing acoustic telemetry data, including: creating a standardized technology agnostic project database, importing raw data directly from receiver downloads, identifying and removing multipath, synchronizing clocks, positioning fish in 3D space, and visualizing resultant point clouds with kernel density functions. In future iterations of the software, we will replace the functional sample scripts with a Jupyter Notebook to guide users through training, classification, and data preparation.

Just open up the Project Notebook and get started

    "# jsats3D Project Notebook\n",
    "jsats3d was developed by Kleinschmidt to assist researchers with cleaning and managing small scale acoustic telemetry studies (<1000 tagged individuals, <20 receivers)  The resulting dataset represents a standardized, repeatable and defensible product.  This notebook carries out every task one may have when analyzing acoustic telemetry data, including: creating a standardized technology agnostic project database, importing raw data directly from receiver downloads, identifying and removing multipath, synchronizing clocks, positioning fish in 3D space, and visualizing resultant point clouds with kernel density functions.  In future iterations of the software, we will replace the functional sample scripts with a Jupyter Notebook to guide users through training, classification, and data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acoustic telemetry projects create vast quantities of data.  To handle the amount of data generated by these projects, jsats3d relies on a SQLite project database.  SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, server-less, zero configuration, transactional SQL database engine (SQLite, 2017).  More importantly, SQLite can handle simultaneous reads, so it is well-suited for write-once, read-many largescale data analysis projects that employ parallel processing across multiple cores.  To view the SQLite project database download either: [sqlite browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) or [sqlite studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt) .  Both SQLite viewers can execute SQL statements, meaning you can create a query and export to csv file from within the database viewer.  They are not that different from Microsoft Access, users familiar with databases will have an easy transition into SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software is written in Python 3.7.x and uses dependencies outside of the standard packages.  Please make sure you have the following modules installed and updated when running telemetry analysis: Numpy, Pandas, Networkx, Matplotlib, Sqlite3, Statsmodels, and SciKit Learn.  The software also uses a number of standard packages including: Time, Math, Os, Datetime, Operator, and Collections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The project notebook will guide the end user through a coplete acoustic telemetry project.  However, you could import jsats3d into your own proprietary scripts and data management routines.  The provided scripts and notebooks are examples only and represent current best practices \n",
